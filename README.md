# Prediction-of-Dementia-using-Ensemble-Machine-Learning-Methods

In this project, we have utilized ensemble machine learning techniques to enhance the prediction of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease. By integrating various algorithms such as Random Forest and AdaBoost, we aimed to improve the accuracy and robustness of dementia risk prediction compared to single models. 

Our approach involved analyzing relevant data including medical history, cognitive tests (like MMSE), age, gender, and education to develop a predictive model. The emphasis was on responsible application, ensuring interpretability of the ensemble model to understand the factors influencing predictions.

The objective is to contribute to advancements in dementia prediction tools, enabling earlier diagnoses and potentially slowing down disease progression. This project addresses the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods by offering a more efficient and potentially cost-effective approach to identifying individuals at risk of dementia.

Important Features in the Dataset:

MMSE (Mini-mental State Examination score):
The range of MMSE is from 0 [worst] to 30 [best]. The MMSE is a 30-point test used to measure thinking ability. The test is also used by researchers who study Alzheimer’s, in order to know a person’s level or stage of dementia. It is the most widely used test for assessing dementia. A score below 24 is considered indicative of dementia, but it’s not enough alone to say that someone who scored 23 or less has dementia. 

Scoring the MMSE:

To calculate the test taker’s score, it is simply a matter of counting the correct
answers. The sum of the correct answers equals the test taker’s score. There
are 30 questions and therefore the highest possible score is 30. MMSE scores
in relation to the severity of dementia is shown in the table below.

Mini-Mental State Exam Scoring Chart:

Score Level of Dementia
24 and higher Normal cognition; no dementia

19 – 23 Mild dementia 

10 – 18 Moderate dementia 

9 and lower Severe dementia 

nWBV (Normalized whole brain volume): 
The intracranial volume is defined as the “volume within the cranium, including the brain,”

eTIV (Estimated total intracranial volume): 
The intracranial volume is defined as the “volume within the cranium, including the brain”, The eTIV is the total estimated total intracranial volume

Age (Patient's age at the time of data collection): 
This the Age of the patient at the time of data collection the higher the age of the patient the higher the risk of having dementia. After age 65, it is known that the risk of Alzheimer's doubles every five years.

EDUC (Years of education): 
This the years in which the patients spending in education. Over the past decade, studies on dementia have consistently showed that the more time you spend in education, the lower your risk of dementia.

MR Delay (The number of days between visit of patients): 
This can be defined as the interval in days between the visits of patients for their MRI scan

SES (Socioeconomic status): 
This can be defined as the socio-economic status of each patient. From researches, it is know that the higher the Socio economic status of a patient the lower the chances of them having dementia.
