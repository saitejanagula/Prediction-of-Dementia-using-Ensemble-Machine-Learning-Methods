# Prediction-of-Dementia-using-Ensemble-Machine-Learning-Methods

In this project, we have utilized ensemble machine learning techniques to enhance the prediction of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease. By integrating various algorithms such as Random Forest and AdaBoost, we aimed to improve the accuracy and robustness of dementia risk prediction compared to single models. 

Our approach involved analyzing relevant data including medical history, cognitive tests (like MMSE), age, gender, and education to develop a predictive model. The emphasis was on responsible application, ensuring interpretability of the ensemble model to understand the factors influencing predictions.

The objective is to contribute to advancements in dementia prediction tools, enabling earlier diagnoses and potentially slowing down disease progression. This project addresses the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods by offering a more efficient and potentially cost-effective approach to identifying individuals at risk of dementia.
